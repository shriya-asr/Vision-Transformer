# Vision-Transformer
A brief implementation of Vision Transformers based on the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale"

Please note that this project has been performed on a very small dataset and is not yet perfected. Further testing and validation on larger datasets are necessary to improve its robustness and accuracy.
